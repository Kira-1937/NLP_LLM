6. For xn+1 = f(xn), which of the following statement is correct?
[3M]
(A) In general, we can not draw cobweb graphs for this diﬀerence equation.

9. A third degree polynomial f(x) = x3 +bx2 +bx+1 can be treated as a characteristic poly-
nomial for some matrix. The same matrix is checked for stability using Jury’s stability
test. Which of the following statement is most appropriate:
[3M]
(A) Jury’s condition can not be applied on this equation because 3rd row is entirely zero.
(B) This equation has at-least one root with absolute value 1 and hence one of the entries
in ﬁrst column at odd numbered rows will be 0.
(C) This system may be stable for some value(s) of b.
(D) In Jury’s test, if the third row has all 0 entries, it does not always imply that equation
has unit magnitude root.

where a, b, c are constants. Which of the following statement is correct?

(A) It is linear diﬀerence equation of order 2 for any value of constants a, b and c.
(B) For h(n) ≡0 and a = c = 1; b = 2, the general solution is asymptotically stable.
(C) For a = 1, b = −0.5 and c = 0; h(n) = 2n, the general solution is stable but not
asymptotically stable.
(D) For a = 1, b = −0.5 and c = 0; h(n) = 2n, the general solution is always unstable.
