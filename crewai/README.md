# AI Assignment

## Overview

This project analyzes a sample blood test report, searches the internet for relevant health articles, and provides health recommendations based on the findings.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AI_Assignment

## Usage
## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
1. create conda env  with python=3.10
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Setting Up Environment Variables
Before running the project, make sure to set up the necessary environment variables. Create a file named .env in the project root directory and add the following:
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here

## Running the Project
To run the project, execute the following command:
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
  This command will start the Streamlit app, allowing you to upload a blood test report and view the analysis and recommendations.

## Approach
We used the CrewAI framework to set up a crew of agents, each responsible for a specific task:

Analyst: Analyzes the blood test report and summarizes the findings.
Researcher: Searches the internet for health articles tailored to the blood test results.
Advisor: Provides personalized health recommendations based on the analysis and found articles.
The tasks are divided into modules, with each module containing a Python file defining the task and its associated agent.


## Step-by-Step Approach
1. Agents
agents/analyst.py
This file defines the Analyst agent, responsible for analyzing the blood test report and summarizing its findings.

agents/researcher.py
This file defines the Researcher agent, tasked with searching the internet for health articles tailored to the blood test results.

agents/advisor.py
This file defines the Advisor agent, which provides personalized health recommendations based on the analysis and found articles.

2. Tasks
tasks/analyze_blood_test.py
This file defines the task of analyzing the blood test report. It specifies the expected output format and assigns the Analyst agent to perform this task.

tasks/find_health_articles.py
This file defines the task of searching for health articles based on the blood test results. It specifies the expected output format and assigns the Researcher agent to perform this task.

tasks/provide_recommendations.py
This file defines the task of providing health recommendations. It specifies the expected output format and assigns the Advisor agent to perform this task.

3. Dashboard
dashboard/app.py
This file contains the Streamlit application code for the dashboard. It allows users to upload a blood test report and view the analysis and recommendations generated by the agents.

4. Output Directory
This directory (output/) stores the output files generated by the tasks, including the summarized blood test report, health articles, and health recommendations.

5. Main Script
main.py
This script initializes the CrewAI framework, sets up the crew of agents, and kicks off the tasks. It ensures that the project's environment variables are properly loaded.

6. Requirements
requirements.txt
This file lists the Python dependencies required to run the project. It ensures that the necessary packages are installed in the project's virtual environment.

7. Environment Variables
.env
This file contains sensitive environment variables, such as the Serper API key, required for the project. It should be kept confidential and not shared publicly.
